It’s still hard for you and for the rest of team."></a>Q: You know this moment is still coming. It’s still hard for you and for the rest of team.</h1><p>Pop: I’m trying to wrap my head aroud why I’m standing here and he’s not.  And we all know why. It’s not Tim Duncun to bring any attention to himself.</p>
<p>We’ve been saying it for 19 years and he really cared about doing the best job he could basketball-wise and being who he was for his teammates. And being a somebody who loved, you know, his family so that’s really who he is. So this is the furthest thing from his mind and so I figured out i better come out here do this, somehow say goodbye to him which is an impossiblity for a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>I tried to think of how to campare and what to say about him. I get a few thoughts that may be boring for all of you. You know everybody always talks about who’d like to eat dinner with. You know, if you have one night to go to dinner, go to lunch with so and so. Who would you like to do it with. People will say, you know, Mother Teresa and Jesus and the Dalai Lama and, OK, I get it. But if you think about a little bit more earthly, worldly type people, you know, people who interesting. I think of people like William F. Buckley on the right and Gore Vidal on the left, when they had their debates – some of you are old enough to remember that stuff – I mean really clever and insightful people and ideas blow your mind and that kind of stuff.  And I can honestly tell you my dinner would be with Timmy. and it is because he is the most real, consitant, true person I’ve ever met in my life. He is so genuine that it blows your mind like Buckley and Vidal would in an avant-garde sort of way.</p>
<p>To spent time with Timmy is really sublime in many ways. People don’t know about his cleverness, you know I think of people like John Cleese, clever, incisive, sarcarstic. Nobody knows that about Timmy. I can be on him in a game asking why he is not rebounding in a relatively stern way and really get on him in front of everybody. and on the way back to the court, he’ll say, “Thanks for the motivation, Pop. Thanks for your support, Pop.” turn away his eyes up here and mobil still laughing.  People don’t see those things. What his teammates have that’s why his teammates love him cause he’s been the best teammate that anybody could ever imagine. Think about how many people have played with him and all Tim Duncun has to do is raise one of his arms, right or left, puts it on their shoulder and it’s a warmth and confident they feel that allows them to becom the best possible player they can be. We have a lot of guys go through here and  be successful and go on to other places. And it’s because Tim Duncun create that environment for whoever came through here to be able to develop and create livings for their families. We are all grateful to him.</p>
<p>It’s not a show of humility in any senses or form. People who grew up with me know me. I would not be standing here if it wasn’t for Tim Duncun. I’d be in the Budweiser League someplace in America, fat and still trying to play basketball or coach basketball. He is why I’m standing here. He’s made living for hundreds of us, staff and coaches, over the years, and neve said a word, just came to work everyday. Came early. Stay late. Was there every single person. from the top of the roster to the bottom of the roster beacuse that’s who he was. So in all those respects he’s irreplaceable. It can’t happen(shrug). We are all unique. But he has been so important to so many people it’s just mind-boggling. To think he’s gonna be gone makes it’s really difficult to imagine walk into practice, going to a game, getting on the bus, taking him a piece of carrot cake, whatever it might be.</p>
<p>He’s been true to himself. I read an article yesterday, i don’t do that often because most of you all write is junk so I don’t read it very much, but this was by Jason Gay from Wall Street Journal. He pretty much got it right on the head about who Timmy is. I don’t know how much basketball he watches or who consulted for the article, but he is right on the money as far as Timmy’s class and humility and consistency over time.  You don’t see Timmy beating his chest as if it was the first time a human being dunk a basketball, as a lot of  people do these days. He’s not pointing to the sky. He’s not glamming to the cameras. He just plays and we’ve seen it for so long that it becomes almost mundane. But so special and it has to be remmembered. This author, to quote him, said ‘he hid in plain sight better than anybody ever seen. ‘ It’s true and I just tried think of somebody like that. I’m a foodie and wine guy so the name that popped into my head was Anthony Bourdain. Nobody knew who the hell he was except foodies. Then he wrote his first book and became popular and all of a sudden he’s on CNN. He is doing his travel shows. He’s erudite and incisive and people love it. He’s talking about the Ramones and he’s talking about hooch and he’s talking about food and everybody says, ‘Who is this guy?’ And he’s been there all along. You just didn’t notice him in the beginning. It’s been that way in Timmy. Greatest player in his position ever to step on a court. And now people saying ‘oh yeah’ that kind of thing. Timmy doesn’t care.</p>
<h1 id="Q-“Did-you-also-read-the-WSJ-piece-about-the-social-psychology-paper-that-Tim-wrote-while-a-junior-at-Wake"><a href="#Q-“Did-you-also-read-the-WSJ-piece-about-the-social-psychology-paper-that-Tim-wrote-while-a-junior-at-Wake" class="headerlink" title="Q:  “Did you also read the WSJ piece about the social psychology paper that Tim wrote while a junior at Wake?"></a>Q:  “Did you also read the WSJ piece about the social psychology paper that Tim wrote while a junior at Wake?</h1><p>Yeah. We all know Timmy is a grad, but he took his education very seriously. It’s something he relishes and is very proud of. But at this point I can tell you that thing that made him the happiest – I’m speaking for him now and I hope I’m  accurate – but I think the thing that made him happiest, beyond the fans and his teammates and all sthat sort of thing, was the time he spent with his two children before games on the bench over there. That’s who he was and that’s who he still is.”</p>
<h1 id="Q-A-lot-of-teams-that-lose-a-superstar-are-left-with-a-big-reconstruction-period-The-Spurs-are-not-in-that-spot-How-much-has-his-unselfishness-as-far-as-salary-helped-with-that"><a href="#Q-A-lot-of-teams-that-lose-a-superstar-are-left-with-a-big-reconstruction-period-The-Spurs-are-not-in-that-spot-How-much-has-his-unselfishness-as-far-as-salary-helped-with-that" class="headerlink" title="Q: A lot of teams that lose a superstar are left with a big reconstruction period.

The Spurs are not in that spot. How much has his unselfishness, as far as salary, helped with that?</h1><p>“Timmy, along with other people, Many and Tony especially, over the years, have sacrificed and allowed us to keep a team together. Of course, R.C. and his staff have been spectacular keeping the talent level up and searching out gems that maybe no one else knew about or paid attention to. The combination of all those things has worked so we can continue to be a competitive team.”</p>
<h1 id="Q-Any-talk-of-him-coming-in-here-to-help-in-the-future-still-be-part-of-this"><a href="#Q-Any-talk-of-him-coming-in-here-to-help-in-the-future-still-be-part-of-this" class="headerlink" title="Q: Any talk of him coming in here to help in the future, still be part of this?"></a>Q: Any talk of him coming in here to help in the future, still be part of this?</h1><p>“He’s too smart to coach, that’s for sure. I don’t think we’re going to see Timmy going up and down the sidelines much. But I have a notion he will at least listen to being involved, somehow or other, maybe even on a part-time basis. I’m certainly going to hit with everything I have to try to keep him around here as long as I possibly can because he means that much to everyone in the organization.”</p>
<h1 id="Q-What-one-thing-will-the-organization-miss-most-with-Duncan-gone"><a href="#Q-What-one-thing-will-the-organization-miss-most-with-Duncan-gone" class="headerlink" title="Q: What one thing will the organization miss most with Duncan gone?"></a>Q: What one thing will the organization miss most with Duncan gone?</h1><p>“I just think the aura that he creates, the iconic figure that he established for us all those years, the security, the safety net, the home plate, the hub of the wheel, all that sort of thing is who he was as a player. Even when he didn’t score as many points the last couple of years, people still don’t realize how efficient he was defensively. Just look to see where he ranked this last year as an individual player defensively, then you’ll figure that out very quickly.</p>
<p>“Offensively, people know how to react because of where he’s at. He’ll move on the court and react when other players wouldn’t have a clue, and they’d just be in the way. But he knows where to go. So even though his production stat-wise wasn’t the same, we won 67 games because he still was the center of everything we did on both ends of the court; even whether people scored more. So we’ll miss that and have to figure it out. Other people will have to step up leadership-wise. That’ll be a huge thing for us: Who’s gonna step up and be that quiet leader that everybody responds to and respects and feeds off of? Not a lot of people can handle that. So we’ll see how that goes.”</p>
<h1 id="Q-Is-there-beauty-in-the-way-Tim-went-out"><a href="#Q-Is-there-beauty-in-the-way-Tim-went-out" class="headerlink" title="Q: Is there beauty in the way Tim went out?"></a>Q: Is there beauty in the way Tim went out?</h1><p>You know everybody is diiferent. People go out in different time for different reasons. This the way one would always expect Timmy to go out. He is the same person as far as his values and opnions of himself as the day he came in. I can still remember before his father passed away, looking at me in the eye saying that “I’m hold you responsible to make sure when he is done he is the same person as he is now.” and in that respect he is. He has grown as a person as we all do through experiences. But his inner core, he was over himself when he  was came in. After all these accolades and all these success, he’s still gotten over himself. He hasn’t changed a lick.</p>
<h1 id="Q-Did-you-try-to-talk-him-out-of-it"><a href="#Q-Did-you-try-to-talk-him-out-of-it" class="headerlink" title="Q: Did you try to talk him out of it?"></a>Q: Did you try to talk him out of it?</h1><p>“No. I’m so tired of coaching him, he’s so stubborn. I would never try to talk him out of anything.”</p>
<p>His ability of accepting direction and coaching was that a  pretty evident of early years some subjective feeling(?)</p>
<p>That’s a great point.  His willingness to allow me and my  staff to coach him and coach him critically, you know, You did well. You did poorly. Here’s the deal. that allowed for a lot of success because that sets a tone for every other players that’s ever come through that door. Because someone like him accepts and wants direction and coaching and responds to it so well. It makes so difficult for anybody else to go in a different direction. That was huge for our success.</p>
<h1 id="Q-What-did-he-teach-you-about-leadership"><a href="#Q-What-did-he-teach-you-about-leadership" class="headerlink" title="Q: What did he teach you about leadership?"></a>Q: What did he teach you about leadership?</h1><p>“That there are all kinds of leadership. His was a quiet [one]. He doesn’t wave a towel. He doesn’t give speeches. When he speaks it’s for a purpose. Less is more in a sense with him. So when he did speak, it meant something to people.</p>
<p>“And he led by example. He had a vision. Everybody bought into his vision. He was accepting. He was not judgmental of people. He didn’t even really need to demand because they knew inherently that what he expected was what they saw in him and what he did every day in practice and in games; how he handled a loss, how he handled that loss in Miami in the Finals, how he handled that win against Miami in the Finals. That’s who he was and that’s how he led.”</p>
<h1 id="Q-Any-games-stick-out"><a href="#Q-Any-games-stick-out" class="headerlink" title="Q: Any games stick out?"></a>Q: Any games stick out?</h1><p>“No, not really. I remember a pretty neat summer league game when he first came in.  Ostertag blocked his shot. That was pretty cool.”</p>
<p>“Yo Timmy.”</p>
<p>“Okay. that’s all I can handle. Have a great summer everybody.”</p>
